Bilotti remains pessimistic about the future of the media empire, which he says is susceptible to the economy and would likely be affected by any economic slowdown. Meanwhile, Prudential Securities' media analyst Katherine Styponais says the Magic Kingdom 'still [has] a ways to go until we see a turnaround.' \"There are a couple of businesses that we will continue to keep an eye on - particularly their consumer products division.\" \"We continue to put a 'hold' on Disney until we see stronger results,\" Styponais said.",
